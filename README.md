GPU Benchmarks Suite
====================

A collection of benchmarking scripts and tools to analyze GPU optimization techniques.

For the moment, you can acquire the core benchmark code (including our modifications)
and datasets by copying `tarjan.cs.txstate.edu:/home/j_g529/parboil_variants_core.tar.gz` 
to your the base `gpu_research_benchmarks/` directory.

If have problems or find bugs, let Josh know!
